_Topography of DLBCL genetic landscape. Coloured hills depict known genetic subtypes. Whilst patients positioned on top of the coloured “hills” will be reproducibly classified by each classification system, patients positioned in the “valleys” may be unclassified or classified alternatively across different classification systems. Hills without colour correspond to unknown DLBCL subtypes which may emerge in the future from currently unclassified cases._

I am first and foremost a **computational clinician**. I look at medicine through big data, thinking about patients I can help in the future. I am focusing on studying cancer genomics with special interest in protein translation. My ambition is to drive change in how we diagnose and treat haematological malignancies. This is a team effort, therefore I am a committed advocate for **open science**. I believe that transparency, collaboration, and accessibility serve as catalysts for accelerated progress in science. 

Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher in [Dr Daniel Hodson’s lab](https://www.stemcells.cam.ac.uk/people/pi/hodson) at the University of Cambridge. I am also participating in the [EHA-EMBL/EBI Computational Biology Training in Hematology](https://ehaweb.org/research/research-trainings/eha-emblebi-computational-biology-training-in-hematology-2/winners-of-cbth/), run by the [European Haematology Association](https://ehaweb.org) a year-long programme for early-career researchers interested in computational haematology. 

### Current projects

#### :dart: Liquid biopsy platform for precision medicine trials in DLBCL 

The [DIRECT Trial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgl6z_Y7IyI) is a *prospective* molecular profiling trial of patients undergoing first-line therapy for DLBCL. We are developing a customised capture panel and analytical pipeline AULE (Automated Ultrasensitive Lymphoma Evaluation) for ultrasensitive assessment of ctDNA in patients with DLBCL. Our mission is to make liquid biopsy diagnostics avaliable for NHS patients.

#### :crystal_ball: What is the role of microproteins in lymphoma and immunity?

The human genome is believed to encompass around 20,000 protein-coding sequences. However, recent advancements in sequencing technologies, like Ribo-Seq, have opened up exciting possibilities for re-evaluating the landscape of translated Open Reading Frames (ORFs). This project aims to undertake a comprehensive examination of non-canonical ORFs in B-cells. There is potential for this project to reveal an entire new level of regulation in B cell malignancy and immunity.

#### ⚖️ Balancing proteostasis during lymphoma development 

The maintenance of protein synthesis and folding homeostasis is critical for cellular survival. When the rate of protein production surpasses the cellular capacity for protein folding, apoptosis is initiated. The MYC oncogene boost protein translation, which becomes toxic to cells when deregulated. MYC deregulation is a hallmark of Burkitt's Lymphoma, one of the most aggressive forms of cancer in humans. Our findings revealed that the loss of DDX3X, an RNA helicase, mitigates the proteotoxic stress induced by oncogenic MYC. Additionally, we have suggested a potential mechanism for the observed male bias in Burkitt's Lymphoma.
