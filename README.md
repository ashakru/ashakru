_Computational Haematology and Genomics_

I am first and foremost a **computational clinician**. I look at medicine through big data, thinking about patients I can help in the future. I am focusing on studying cancer genomics with special interest in protein translation. My ambition is to drive change in how we diagnose and treat haematological malignancies. This is a team effort, therefore I am a committed advocate for **open science**. I believe that transparency, collaboration, and accessibility serve as catalysts for accelerated progress in science. 

Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher in [Dr Daniel Hodsonâ€™s lab](https://www.stemcells.cam.ac.uk/people/pi/hodson) at the University of Cambridge.
