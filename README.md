_Computational Haematology and Genomics_

I am first and foremost a **computational clinician**. I look at medicine through big data, thinking about patients I can help in the future. I am focusing on studying cancer genomics with special interest in protein translation. My ambition is to drive change in how we diagnose and treat haematological malignancies. This is a team effort, therefore I am a committed advocate for **open science**. I believe that transparency, collaboration, and accessibility serve as catalysts for accelerated progress in science. 

Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher in [Dr Daniel Hodsonâ€™s lab](https://www.stemcells.cam.ac.uk/people/pi/hodson) at the University of Cambridge. 

### Current projects

#### Liquid biopsy platform for precision medicine trials in DLBCL 

The [DIRECT Trial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgl6z_Y7IyI) is a *prospective* molecular profiling trial of patients undergoing first-line therapy for DLBCL. We are developing a customised capture panel and analytical pipeline AULE (Automated Ultrasensitive Lymphoma Evaluation) for ultrasensitive assessment of ctDNA in patients with DLBCL. Our mission is to make liquid biopsy diagnostics avaliable for NHS patients.

#### What is the role of microproteins in lymphoma and immunity?

The human genome is believed to encompass around 20,000 protein-coding sequences. However, recent advancements in sequencing technologies, like Ribo-Seq, have opened up exciting possibilities for re-evaluating the landscape of translated Open Reading Frames (ORFs). This project aims to undertake a comprehensive examination of non-canonical ORFs in B-cells. There is potential for this project to reveal an entire new level of regulation in B cell malignancy and immunity.
